The key factor is security of the
information such as password that is used for authentication.
Besides, all identification related information follow the first
authentication step. We propose a simple, yet elegant method
called Mobile PassPattern System (MPPS) to solve the
authentication problem in a ubiquitous manner. We have shown
that MPPS withstands all known attacks relevant to this mode of
authentication.
